# ManyMusic-Stim

We[^1] presents the `ManyMusic-Stim` dataset, an open-access music audio dataset designed for human experiments on musical emotions.

## ü§î Another music dataset‚Äîwhy?

Psychological and neuroscientific research on music-evoked emotions has long been constrained by limitations in stimulus selection. Common issues include the use of artificially manipulated stimuli, copyright restrictions preventing data sharing, narrow genre sampling, and experimenter bias. The `ManyMusic-Stim` dataset addresses these challenges by offering a large-scale, open-access collection of music audio files curated to ensure diverse representation across genres and styles.

## üî¨ How was it validated?

We conducted a series of experiments comparing the `ManyMusic-Stim` dataset to commercial music. Our results show that [carefully curated](/stim/plots_music.html) subsets of the dataset are comparable to well-matched commercial tracks across various subjective ratings, including liking and feeling moved. These [findings](/stim/plots_bhv.html) provide empirical support for the use of `ManyMusic-Stim` as a valid alternative to commercial music in affective research.

See our [paper] for more details.

## üòÄ How to use it?

The `ManyMusic-Stim` dataset is available for download from [Zenodo].
The dataset includes: 

- audio files in `MP3` format, 
- metadata in `CSV` format, and 
- subjective ratings of musical emotions in `CSV` format.

The audio files are encoded at 320 kbps.
The metadata includes information such as the title, artist, genre, and duration of each track.
The subjective ratings of musical emotions include ratings for perceived valence, arousal, liking, feeling moved, familiarity, and professionalism, collected from 200+ [Prolific] participants.
